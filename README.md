# 🎮 Spielenium

[![Build](https://github.com/evgenius1424/spielenium/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/evgenius1424/spielenium/actions/workflows/build.yml)

**Spielenium** is a fun playground for creating **couch games** and interactive widgets.  
Think: _one big screen to play on, and everyone else joins in from their phone, tablet, or laptop as a remote
controller._

## ✨ Features (planned)

- 🕹️ **Couch Games** — play anagrams, trivia, guess-the-price, and more
- 📱 **Remote Control** — use any device with a browser as your input field or controller
- 📺 **Main Display Mode** — connect a big screen for the main game session
- ⚡ **Turborepo Setup** — structured monorepo for frontend, backend, and game modules
- 🎲 **Extensible** — easy to add new games or widgets

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/) for monorepo setup
- TypeScript (frontend + backend)
- React for UI
- WebSockets / SSE for real-time game interactions

_(more details to come as the project grows)_
